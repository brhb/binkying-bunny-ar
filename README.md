# Binkying Bunny AR  

**An augmented reality (AR) project that brings joy to your room with a playful, binkying rabbit!** üêá  

This project uses **computer vision** and **augmented reality** to project a virtual Stanford Bunny onto a flat surface, such as a table, in an image of a room. Once placed, the bunny performs delightful binkying animations (a playful jump that real rabbits do when they're happy), creating a fun and interactive experience.

### Update
Actually, the bunny is sad, it can juste move. Once it is happy, it will be binkying 

## Features  
- **Augmented Reality Placement**: Detects flat surfaces (like tables) in an image and accurately positions the virtual bunny.  
- **Dynamic Animations**: The bunny performs realistic binkying animations to mimic a joyful rabbit.  
- **3D Modeling**: Utilizes the iconic Stanford Bunny model for high-quality rendering.  
- **Interactive Experience**: Users can change the bunny's position or animation settings for added engagement.  

## Technologies Used  
- **OpenCV**: For surface detection and computer vision processing.  
- **AR Framework**: Integration with AR libraries such as OpenCV with OpenGL, or ARKit/ARCore for extended functionality.  
- **3D Animation**: Blender or Unity for pre-animated binkying sequences.  
- **Python**: Backend implementation and scripting for core functionalities.
